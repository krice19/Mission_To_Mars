# Mission_To_Mars

## Summary

This challenge will scrape various websites to extract information on our own web app. We start with a python file to scrape the website and connect it back to our app.py file, which connects this file to flask and mongodb.  We then use the data in mongodb to extract it into our html which will customize  our web app to show facts about mars and provide images supporting our information.
